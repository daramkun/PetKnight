Marketplace Terms

This website is owned and operated by GameDev Network Limited, a company incorporated in England (company number 8951892; VAT number 202253758) whose registered office is at Baltic Co-Working Space, 12 Jordan Street, Liverpool, UK, L1 0BP (“GDN” or “we” or “us”). Our site features an online marketplace which allows registered users of our site (“Members“) to sell and purchase a licence in respect of Assets (“Marketplace”).

These terms (“Marketplace Terms”) govern how the Marketplace operates, how Assets may be licensed via the Marketplace, how such licences may be sold and purchased and how the relevant Assets may be used. These Marketplace Terms apply in addition to the Terms of Website Use, Acceptable Use Policy, Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy.

Please read these Marketplace Terms carefully and make sure that you understand them, before using the Marketplace. In particular, please note the provisions of clauses 3.6 and 3.7 which affect your cancellation rights.

Please note that by using the Marketplace (whether as a Purchaser or Seller), you agree to be bound by these Marketplace Terms and the other documents expressly referred to in it.

1. DEFINITIONS:
1. In these Marketplace Terms, the following definitions apply (in addition to the other definitions herein):
“Asset(s)” means any work, information, data, software, executable code, image, drawing, animation, audio content or video content in any digital medium or form including (but not limited to) 2D image files, 3D design files, GUI elements and audio files.
“Derivative Work” means a modification or addition to a Licensed Asset or any other form in which a Licensed Asset may be recast, transformed or adapted.
“Licence(s)” has the definition set out in clause 4.1.
“Licensed Asset” means an Asset in respect of which a Licence has been sold by a Seller and purchased by a Purchaser via the Marketplace.
“Media Product” means any digital and/or media product, creation or platform of a Purchaser including (but not limited to) software, applications, video content, audio content, documents and websites.
“Monetized Media Product” means a Media Product which, in addition to any original sale price of the Media Product, is capable of producing further income, profits, gains and any other financial consideration, value, receipt or measure for any party by any means whatsoever, including (but not limited to) via in-app purchase facilities or advertising.
“Non-Monetized Media Product” means a Media Product in relation to which, other than the original sale price of the Media Product, no party is capable of receiving any further income, profits, gains and any other financial consideration, value, receipt or measure by any means whatsoever, including (but not limited to) via in-app purchase facilities or advertising.
“Purchaser” means a Member who purchases a Licence of an Asset by way of sub-licence from GDN via the Marketplace.
“Seller” a Member who offers to grant a Licence of an Asset to GDN for sub-license to other Members via the Marketplace.

2. THE MARKETPLACE
2.1. Members may;
(a) sell Licences in respect of their Assets to GDN for sub-license to other Members via the Marketplace;
(b) purchase Licences by way of sub-licence from GDN in respect of other Members’ Assets via the Marketplace; and
(c) browse or access the Marketplace;

in accordance with these Marketplace Terms.

3. PURCHASE OF LICENCES 

3.1. The Licences dictate how the Assets may be used by the Purchaser.
3.2. GDN is party to Licences purely for the purpose of licensing the applicable Licensed Asset from Sellers and sub-licensing the applicable Licensed Asset to Purchasers.
3.3. The prices of the Licences (“Purchase Prices”) will be as quoted on the Marketplace from time to time.
3.4. The Marketplace contains a large number of Assets. The Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that despite GDN’s reasonable precautions, Purchase Prices may be listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to a typographical error or similar oversight. In these circumstances, GDN reserves the right to cancel or reverse a transaction, even after an order has been confirmed and a payment has been processed. If a transaction is cancelled, GDN will arrange for any payment to be credited or refunded.
3.5. For the steps the Purchaser needs to take to place an order on the Marketplace, see the “How To Buy” page.
3.6. By virtue of submitting an order for a Licence via the Marketplace, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have consented to being supplied the applicable Licensed Asset for download in accordance with clause 3.13 before the end of any statutory cancellation period to which the Purchaser would otherwise be entitled and the Purchaser acknowledges that, as a result, the Purchaser will lose any such cancellation right and GDN hereby confirms to the Purchaser such consent and acknowledgement.
3.7. Neither the Seller nor the Purchaser may cancel an order for a Licence once the order has been submitted via the Marketplace.
3.8. GDN does not give any undertaking as to the continued availability of Assets offered for Licence via the Marketplace.
3.9 The contracts between the Seller and GDN and between the Purchaser and GDN will each only be formed when GDN confirms acceptance of an order.
3.10. The Purchaser must pay the Purchase Price in full via Paypal. 
3.11. Once the Purchase Price has been received by GDN, GDN will send the Purchaser and Seller an e-mail that confirms that the Purchase Price has been received (“Purchase Confirmation”). 
3.12. A Licence shall be granted simultaneously from the Seller to GDN and (by way of sub-licence thereof) from GDN to the Purchaser and shall become effective once GDN has issued the Purchase Confirmation. For the avoidance of doubt, GDN’s entry into a Licence with a Seller is subject to and conditional upon GDN entering into a related Licence with a Purchaser and receiving the Purchase Price from the Purchaser, failing which GDN shall not be bound by the Licence with the Seller and GDN’s entry into a Licence with a Purchaser is subject to and conditional upon GDN entering into a related Licence with a Seller, failing which GDN shall not be bound by the Licence with the Purchaser.
3.13. A Licensed Asset may be downloaded by the Purchaser from the Marketplace immediately following notification of its availability for download by GDN.
3.14. Subject to clauses 3.8 and 3.16(d), during its availability on the Marketplace a Licensed Asset and each new version (if any) of that Licensed Asset may be downloaded by the Purchaser from the Marketplace no more than five times.
3.15. Should the Purchaser wish to obtain a full or partial refund in relation to a Licence, the Purchaser should contact GDN to mediate and resolve the dispute.
3.16. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Seller nor GDN shall be obliged to provide a refund in respect of a Licence where the Purchaser;
a) no longer wishes to make use of a Licence or Licensed Asset;
b) purchased the Licence by mistake;
c) does not have sufficient expertise to use the Licensed Asset; or
d) can no longer access a Licensed Asset because it has been removed by its Seller from the Marketplace.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, GDN shall not be liable to any Member for any costs, expenses, loss or damage (whether direct, indirect or consequential and whether economic or other) arising from GDN’s exercise of the rights granted to it under these Marketplace Terms (including sub-licensing Licences to Purchasers).
8.5. Each Member shall indemnify GDN against all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages or losses (including any direct, indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation and all interest, penalties and legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity basis) and all other professional costs and expenses) suffered or incurred by GDN arising out of or in connection with:

9. GENERAL
9.1. GDN may sub-contract, sub-license, delegate or otherwise transfer GDN’s rights and obligations under these Marketplace Terms to another organisation, but this will not affect a Member’s rights under these Marketplace Terms.
9.2. A Member may only sub-contract, sub-license, delegate or otherwise transfer its rights or its obligations under these Marketplace Terms to another person if GDN agrees in writing.
9.3. Each clause of these Marketplace Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining clauses will remain in full force and effect.
9.4. If GDN fails to insist that a Member performs any of its obligations under these Marketplace Terms, or if GDN does not enforce GDN’s rights against a Member, or if GDN delays in doing so, that will not mean that GDN has waived GDN’s rights against the Member and will not mean that Members do not have to comply with those obligations. If GDN does waive a default by a Member, GDN will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that GDN will automatically waive any later default by a Member.
9.5. These Marketplace Terms are governed by English law. This means these Marketplace Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or the Marketplace will be governed by English law. The courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction.

This Acceptable Use Policy sets out the terms between you and us under which you may access our website GameDevMarket.net (“our site”). This acceptable use policy applies to all users of, and visitors to, our site. Your use of our site means that you accept, and agree to abide by, all the policies in this acceptable use policy, which supplement our Terms of Website Use and Marketplace Terms.

PROHIBITED USES
Other than as set out in the Marketplace Terms, use of our site does not grant to you any ownership of any content, code, data or materials you may access or any intellectual property rights subsisting any content, code, data or materials you may access. You may use our site only for lawful purposes. You may not use our site:

In any way that breaches any applicable local, national or international law or regulation.
In any way that is unlawful or fraudulent, or has any unlawful or fraudulent purpose or effect.
For the purpose of harming or attempting to harm minors in any way.
To send, knowingly receive, upload, download, use or re-use any material which does not comply with our Content Standards.
To transmit, or procure the sending of, any unsolicited or unauthorised advertising or promotional material or any other form of similar solicitation (spam).
To knowingly transmit any data, send or upload any material that contains viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time-bombs, keystroke loggers, spyware, adware or any other harmful programs or similar computer code designed to adversely affect the operation of any computer software or hardware.
You also agree:

Not to reproduce, duplicate, copy or re-sell any part of our site in contravention of the provisions of our Terms of Website.

INTERACTIVE SERVICES
We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site, including, without limitation:

Chat rooms;
Bulletin boards; and
Discussion Forums.
(“interactive services”).Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical). We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our Content Standards, whether the service is moderated or not. The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not foolproof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them. Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.

These standards (“Content Standards”) apply to any and all content (as defined in the Terms of Website) and other material which you contribute to our site (“contributions”), and to any interactive services associated with it.
